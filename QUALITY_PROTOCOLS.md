# QUALITY PROTOCOLS - Assessment & Improvement Workflows

## Mission Statement
**IMPERATIVE**: Systematic quality assessment and improvement through efficient protocols. Command-driven quality workflows, objective scoring, continuous improvement focus.

## 4-Dimension Quality Framework

### Scoring Matrix (1-10 scale)
```
DIMENSION                    WEIGHT   CRITERIA
Task Completion              25%      Solves stated problem completely
Code Quality                 25%      Maintainable, follows conventions  
Professional Discipline      25%      Proper tool usage, protocol adherence
Information Entropy          25%      Valuable insights discovered/documented

TARGET SCORE: ≥7.5 overall | EXCELLENCE: ≥9.0 | MINIMUM: ≥6.0
```

### Quality Assessment Command
```
assess quality [component]

EXECUTE Assessment:
1. Task Completion Score (1-10):
   - Requirements fully met?
   - Edge cases handled?
   - User satisfaction achieved?

2. Code Quality Score (1-10):
   - Follows Claude_Nexus conventions (KISS/YAGNI/DRY)?
   - Maintainable by future developers?
   - Appropriate error handling?

3. Professional Discipline Score (1-10):
   - MCP tool hierarchy followed?
   - Proper workflow protocols applied?
   - Git Commitment Protocol executed?

4. Information Entropy Score (1-10):
   - Surprising insights discovered?
   - Valuable patterns documented?
   - Knowledge applicable beyond current task?

CALCULATE: Weighted Average = (Sum of weighted scores) / 4
RESULT: Overall Score [X.X] / 10
```

## Self-Critique Protocol (4-Phase Improvement)

### `apply critique [scope]`
```
EXECUTE Self-Critique Cycle:

PHASE 1 - CREATOR:
- Generate comprehensive initial solution
- Focus on functionality and requirements
- Document implementation decisions
- Optimize for user value delivery

PHASE 2 - CRITIC:
- Challenge all assumptions systematically
- Identify edge cases and failure modes
- Assess security, performance, integration risks
- Question design choices and alternatives

PHASE 3 - DEFENDER:
- Address each criticism systematically
- Implement improvements and fixes
- Validate solutions don't introduce regressions
- Document responses to criticisms

PHASE 4 - JUDGE:
- Compare original vs improved solution
- Apply 4-dimension quality assessment
- Determine if quality meets standards (≥7.5)
- Approve for completion or require iteration
```

### Self-Critique Scope Decision
```
Task Complexity Assessment:

HIGH-IMPACT (Full 4-Phase Cycle):
- New feature implementations
- Architectural decisions
- Security-sensitive changes
- Performance-critical code

MEDIUM-IMPACT (Critic + Defender minimum):
- Code refactoring
- Bug fixes affecting multiple components
- Integration implementations

LOW-IMPACT (Quick Self-Review):
- Simple bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Minor configuration changes
```

## Quality Gate Workflows

### Pre-Implementation Quality Gate
```
validate readiness [task]

EXECUTE Readiness Check:
1. Requirements clearly understood?
2. Implementation approach planned?
3. Quality criteria defined?
4. Success criteria measurable?
5. Tools and dependencies available?

GATE: Cannot proceed until all criteria met
```

### Mid-Implementation Quality Gate
```
check progress [milestone]

EXECUTE Progress Validation:
1. mcp__serena__think_about_task_adherence
2. Current implementation quality assessment
3. Remaining work scope verification
4. Risk assessment and mitigation planning
5. Resource allocation adjustment if needed

GATE: Address deviations before continuing
```

### Completion Quality Gate
```
validate completion [deliverable]

EXECUTE Completion Validation:
1. mcp__serena__think_about_whether_you_are_done
2. Full 4-dimension quality assessment
3. User acceptance criteria verification
4. Integration testing completion
5. Documentation and knowledge capture

GATE: Score ≥7.5 required for approval
```

## Quality Improvement Commands

### `improve quality [aspect]`
```
EXECUTE Quality Improvement:

1. Identify specific quality dimension needing improvement
2. Apply targeted improvement strategy:

   Task Completion Issues:
   - Revisit requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Implement missing functionality
   - Address edge cases and error conditions

   Code Quality Issues:
   - Apply Claude_Nexus conventions (KISS/YAGNI/DRY)
   - Improve maintainability and readability
   - Enhance error handling and logging

   Professional Discipline Issues:
   - Follow MCP tool hierarchy properly
   - Apply workflow protocols systematically
   - Complete documentation requirements

   Information Entropy Issues:
   - Extract and document valuable insights
   - Identify reusable patterns
   - Capture learning for future reference

3. Re-assess quality after improvements
4. Iterate until target score achieved
```

### `optimize workflow [process]`
```
EXECUTE Workflow Optimization:
1. Identify workflow bottlenecks or inefficiencies
2. Analyze root causes of quality issues
3. Design improved process incorporating lessons learned
4. Test improved workflow on representative tasks
5. Document optimized workflow patterns
6. Update quality protocols based on insights
```

## Quality Pattern Library
