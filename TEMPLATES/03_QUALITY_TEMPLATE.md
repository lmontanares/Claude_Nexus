SCORE: [Total] / 10

OVERALL SCORE: (Sum * 0.25) = [X.X] / 10
TARGET: ≥7.5 | EXCELLENCE: ≥9.0
```

## `apply critique [scope]`

### Self-Critique 4-Phase Workflow
```
PHASE 1 - CREATOR:
□ Generate comprehensive solution
□ Focus on functionality and user value
□ Document implementation decisions
□ Optimize for requirement fulfillment

PHASE 2 - CRITIC:
□ Challenge all assumptions
□ Identify edge cases and failure modes
□ Assess security, performance, integration risks
□ Question design choices and alternatives

PHASE 3 - DEFENDER:
□ Address each criticism systematically
□ Implement improvements and fixes
□ Validate no regression introduced
□ Document criticism responses

PHASE 4 - JUDGE:
□ Compare original vs improved solution
□ Apply 4-dimension quality assessment
□ Determine if quality meets standards (≥7.5)
□ Approve or require additional iteration
```

### Critique Scope Decision
```
HIGH-IMPACT (Full 4-Phase):
□ New feature implementations
□ Architectural decisions
□ Security-sensitive changes
□ Performance-critical code

MEDIUM-IMPACT (Critic + Defender):
□ Code refactoring
□ Multi-component bug fixes
□ Integration implementations

LOW-IMPACT (Quick Review):
□ Simple bug fixes
□ Documentation updates
□ Minor configuration changes
```

## Quality Improvement Commands

### `improve quality [dimension]`
```
TASK COMPLETION Issues:
□ Revisit requirements and acceptance criteria
□ Implement missing functionality
□ Address edge cases and error conditions
□ Validate user workflow end-to-end

CODE QUALITY Issues:
□ Apply Claude_Nexus conventions systematically
□ Improve maintainability and readability
□ Enhance error handling and logging
□ Simplify overly complex implementations

PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINE Issues:
□ Follow MCP tool hierarchy properly
□ Apply workflow protocols completely
□ Complete documentation requirements
□ Execute Git Commitment Protocol

INFORMATION ENTROPY Issues:
□ Extract and document valuable insights
□ Identify reusable patterns
□ Capture lessons learned
□ Connect to broader knowledge base
```

## Quality Pattern Templates

### High-Quality Pattern Recognition
```
RECOGNIZE THESE PATTERNS:
□ Symbol-based editing over file manipulation
□ Incremental implementation with validation
□ Appropriate abstraction levels
□ Clear separation of concerns
□ MCP tool hierarchy adherence
□ Systematic workflow application
□ Information entropy focus
□ Proactive quality integration
```

### Anti-Pattern Detection
```
AVOID THESE PATTERNS:
□ Skipping tool hierarchy for convenience
□ Implementing without clear requirements
□ Ignoring edge cases and error conditions
□ Verbose documentation of routine work
□ Quality assessment as afterthought
□ Committing without review cycle
□ Over-engineering speculative features
□ Under-engineering core functionality
```

## Quality Gate Templates

### Pre-Implementation Gate
```
validate readiness [task]
□ Requirements clearly understood
□ Implementation approach planned
□ Quality criteria defined
□ Success criteria measurable
□ Tools and dependencies available

GATE: Cannot proceed until all met
```

### Mid-Implementation Gate
```
check progress [milestone]
□ mcp__serena__think_about_task_adherence
□ Current quality assessment
□ Remaining scope verification
□ Risk assessment and mitigation
□ Resource allocation adjustment

GATE: Address deviations before continuing
```

### Completion Gate
```
validate completion [deliverable]
□ mcp__serena__think_about_whether_you_are_done
□ Full 4-dimension assessment (≥7.5 required)
□ User acceptance criteria verified
□ Integration testing complete
□ Documentation and knowledge captured

GATE: Approval required before staging
```

## Quality Troubleshooting

### Low Quality Score Recovery
```
SCORE < 6.0 (Below minimum):
1. Identify lowest-scoring dimension
2. Apply targeted improvement strategy
3. Re-assess after improvements
4. Iterate until ≥7.5 achieved
5. Document improvement pattern

SCORE 6.0-7.4 (Below target):
1. Focus on highest-impact improvements
2. Apply relevant quality patterns
3. Consider self-critique cycle
4. Validate with stakeholders if needed
5. Document lessons learned
```

### Quality Process Breakdown
```
Quality Protocols Ignored:
1. Immediate quality assessment
2. Identify protocol violation points
3. Apply correct protocols retroactively
4. Document process breakdown causes
5. Strengthen protocol adherence

Quality Degradation Over Time:
1. Audit recent work quality trends
2. Identify degradation causes
3. Refresh quality standards
4. Re-establish quality habits
5. Monitor improvement trends
```

## Quality Metrics Tracking

### Individual Quality Tracking
```
TRACK THESE METRICS:
- Quality scores by task type
- Improvement trends over time
- Tool usage impact on quality
- Protocol adherence correlation
- Self-critique effectiveness

QUALITY LOG ENTRY:
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Task: [Description]
Scores: TC:[X] CQ:[X] PD:[X] IE:[X] Overall:[X.X]
Insights: [Key lessons learned]
Patterns: [Reusable elements identified]
```

### Quality Pattern Learning
```
PATTERN RECOGNITION:
□ Which workflows achieve highest quality?
□ What factors correlate with quality scores?
□ Which tools enhance quality outcomes?
□ How does critique cycle impact scores?
□ What improvement strategies work best?
```
