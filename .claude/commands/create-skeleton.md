# Create Skeleton - Skeleton-First TDD Workflow

Automates the skeleton creation phase for Skeleton-First TDD development process.

## Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
```
Analyze the requirements for: [PROJECT/SPRINT/FEATURE NAME]

What are the main components, files, and modules needed?
```

### 2. Architecture Planning  
```
Plan the file structure and interfaces for this scope.

What functions, classes, and tests need to be created?
```

### 3. Skeleton Generation
```
Create skeleton files with:
- Proper file structure and imports
- Function/class signatures with type hints
- Comprehensive docstrings
- TODO comments for implementation
- Corresponding test file skeletons
```

### 4. Test Structure Setup
```
Create test skeletons that will define specifications:
- Test method signatures for all functions
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Boundary condition tests
```

*Follow the three-phase process: Structure → Tests → Implementation*
